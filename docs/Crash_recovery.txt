Check on the status of the run.

1) Is the swift/t job actually running?
in the directory where the turbine submission was initiated, there is a file
called "turbine-directory.txt" that contains the location of the last submiss'n
output. In that location there is a file called turbine.log that among the 
other things contains "JOB:" the id of the sumitted job.
(on a PBS and most systems)
>qstat -u $(whoami)

should show the job id if it is still running

2) How many jobs were started so far?
from the submittion folder
>find $(cat turbine-directory.txt) -name err.txt | wc

3) How many were completed?

find $(cat turbine-directory.txt) -name out.txt  -exec grep "%%%END OF TCLC" {} \; | wc

Either the number of started jobs is equal to the total, or the difference
between started and completed has to be equal to the number of workers (also in turbine.log)
Otherwise, something isn't working right.
 
4) Look for a core files 

find $(cat turbine-directory.txt) -name core -exec gdb -c {} \;

turbine crashed is somethign like this is in the output
Core was generated by `/soft/swift-t/deps/tcl-8.6.5-gcc-4.9.2/bin/tclsh8.6 swift_run_sweep.tic

5) Find jobs that were already submitted (assumes that the task file is in
../data/input

> find $(cat turbine-directory.txt) -name err.txt | sed 's/.*instance_//' | sed 's|/.*||' | xargs -I line sh -c "sed -n linep ../data/input.txt " >run.jobs

6) Find the list of the jobs that were not run yet

> diff <(sort run.jobs) <(sort ../data/input.txt) | grep  '>' | sed 's/^> //' >new.input

use new.input as a new submission edit swift_run_sweep.sh to read new.input
> ../swift/swift_run_sweep.sh savi_scaleup_PROCS200_PPN8_2
fix the script so that it wont run the wrong input
